A cache for [Ash](https://hexdocs.pm/ash) resources. Reads come back from
memory instead of the database, and the cache clears itself when the data
changes.

## What you get

- **You pick what is cached.** List the reads to cache in a `cache` block on
  the resource.
- **No manual clearing.** When a record is created, updated or deleted, the
  cache for that resource is cleared.
- **No data leaks between users.** Each user and each tenant has their own
  cached results.

## Installation

Add the package to `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ash_cache, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Add the supervisor to your application. It starts the cache stores:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex
children = [
  # ...
  {AshCache.Supervisor, otp_app: :my_app}
]
```

## Usage

Add the extension to a resource and list the reads to cache:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Shop.Product do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyApp.Shop,
    extensions: [AshCache.Resource]

  cache do
    reads [:get_by_sku]
  end
end
```

The `get_by_sku` read now comes from the cache. Other reads go to the
database as before. Entries expire after an hour, and the cache clears when
a product is created, updated or deleted.

To change how long entries live, set `ttl`:

```elixir
cache do
  reads [:get_by_sku]
  ttl :timer.minutes(5)
end
```

The [Examples](documentation/topics/examples.md) page has a block for each
common situation.

  common situation.

  on several nodes, and writing your own adapter.
- [How to test with AshCache](documentation/topics/testing.md): keep
  parallel tests apart, turn caching off for one test.

  a cache key, how clearing works, and the limits.
- [DSL reference](documentation/dsls/DSL-AshCache.Resource.md): every
  option in the `cache` block.

## Limits

- **The cache clears per resource, not per record.** Any write to a
  resource clears every cached read of that resource.
- **Related records can go stale.** A cached read that loads related
  records keeps the old related records until the entry expires. Keep
  `load` off cached reads, or choose a short `ttl`.
- **Each node has its own cache.** On several nodes, a write clears the
  cache only on the node that made it. See [Storage](documentation/topics/storage.md).
- **Writes get a little slower.** Each write has to clear the cache.
  Measure before caching a resource that is written to constantly.

<summary>Instructions for coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, ...)</summary>
<p>
The file for agents is
<a href="https://github.com/Undeadlol1/ash_cache/blob/main/usage-rules.md"><code>usage-rules.md</code></a>.
It ships inside the package, so after <code>mix deps.get</code> it is at
<code>deps/ash_cache/usage-rules.md</code>. Point your agent at that file.
If your project uses the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/usage_rules"><code>usage_rules</code></a>
package, add <code>:ash_cache</code> to its list instead.
